# IP Scanner
Lil project I'm working on, basically just a baby version of nmap. It's not supposed to be used over nmap, just as a test for myself to try and learn python.

Stuff to still do:
- [x] Write to an external file (allow user to choose if they want it to)
- [x] Check for OSs running and their versions
- [ ] Add a whois lookup
